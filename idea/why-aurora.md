# Why Aurora?

As a writer myself, Iâ€™ve often felt that existing writing forums miss something essential: 
a space that nurtures growth, appreciation, and true community.  
**Aurora** is my attempt to build that space.

### ðŸŒ± Constructive Feedback
Most online platforms donâ€™t provide the room for writers to grow. Feedback often falls short â€” either too shallow, too harsh, or too vague.  
Aurora aims to change this with a **rewarding system for reviewers**, encouraging thoughtful, constructive responses that genuinely help authors improve.

### ðŸ–‹ Multi-paradigm Support
Writing isnâ€™t one-dimensional. Itâ€™s poetry, prose, essays, plays â€” and so much more.  
Aurora is not just about one form of writing, but **all forms**. As the platform evolves, weâ€™ll introduce dedicated editors for each style, and eventually let writers **define their own paradigms** of expression.

### ðŸ”„ Feedback Exchange
Feedback should be a two-way street.  
On Aurora, writers will earn points for giving meaningful feedback â€” and spend those points to **request feedback from others**. This way, we nurture a cycle of growth and collaboration.

### âœ¨ And Beyond
Aurora is still in its early stages, but this is only the beginning. Weâ€™re building with writers, for writers â€” and weâ€™ll keep expanding as the community grows.
