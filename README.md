# 🌌 Aurora

> *“A dawn for writers — where words don’t just exist, they grow.”*  

Aurora is a **community platform for writers** — poems, stories, essays, plays, and beyond — designed not just for publishing, but for **growth through meaningful feedback**.  

---

## ✨ Vision
Most writing forums today feel incomplete: feedback is shallow, appreciation is rare, and writers struggle to grow.
Aurora reimagines what a writer’s community could be: supportive, constructive, and inspiring.  

---

## 🔑 Key Features (Planned)
- **🌱 Constructive Feedback**  
  Rewarding system that encourages thoughtful, helpful critiques instead of generic comments.  

- **🖋 Multi-Paradigm Writing**  
  Support for multiple forms of writing — poetry, prose, essays, plays, and more.  
  Future versions will include **specialized editors** tailored for each style.  

- **🔄 Feedback Economy**  
  Writers earn points by giving feedback, and spend those points to request reviews from others.  
  A cycle that sustains growth and collaboration.  

- **🚀 Built to Expand**  
  Aurora is still in its early stages, but the vision is clear:  
  - More tools for writers  
  - Community-driven features  
  - A platform shaped by those who use it  

---

## 📖 Why Aurora?
Because every writer deserves more than just a place to post their work.  
Aurora is about **nurturing talent, sparking creativity, and building a community that grows together**.
